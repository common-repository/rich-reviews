More importantly for webmasters and those concerned with SEO is that this shortcode tags the aggregate score with Rich Snippet markup so that Google (and other search engines) will see the average score on that page, and display stars next to that page when it shows up in search results.', 'rich-reviews'); ?><br />

It might take some time for the stars to show up next to your page, and it might only show up with specific search terms. The best thing you can do is make sure that the Rich Snippets tool, above, recognizes the star rating on your page, and be patient.
